# Sharyn JS

Collection of helpers to build a JS app. At the moment, this is pretty much a personal library for my own projects, and for projects that strictly follow my [JS Stack from Scratch](https://github.com/verekia/js-stack-from-scratch) tutorial ([major update](https://github.com/verekia/js-stack-from-scratch/issues/255) coming soon).

The following packages are available:

- [@sharyn/cli](https://github.com/sharynjs/cli) – Convenient NPM scripts
- [@sharyn/material-ui](https://github.com/sharynjs/material-ui) – UI components using Material UI

## Why 'Sharyn'?

It's a reference to one of my favorite metalcore song, [Rose of Sharyn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgMsACFMIq8) by Killswitch Engage.
