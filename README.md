# ðŸŒ¹ Sharyn

Sharyn is a collection of packages that make your life easier and reduce your boilerplate code in a JavaScript project. Some packages are useful for any project (like the Babel, ESLint, or Prettier configurations), and some are specifically made to build a full-stack production-ready React app.

For full-stack projects, Sharyn is almost a framework. _Almost_ because you get to pick which modules you use instead of a monolithic black box. A round-up of its features and technical bricks is available on the [**tech stack**](https://github.com/sharynjs/sharyn/blob/master/docs/stack.md) page.

Sharyn will work wonders for projects that follow the upcoming [major update](https://github.com/verekia/js-stack-from-scratch/issues/255) of my [**JS Stack from Scratch**](https://github.com/verekia/js-stack-from-scratch) tutorial.

## ðŸŒ¹ Getting Started

To get started, follow the [**setup tutorial**](https://github.com/sharynjs/sharyn/blob/master/docs/1-setup-common.md) or download the [**sharyn-boilerplate**](https://github.com/sharynjs/sharyn-boilerplate) project.

I recommend the tutorial the first time you use Sharyn, and the boilerplate once you're familiar with the stack.
